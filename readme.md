## HTML & CSS - Bootstrap

## Description



I made a semi responsive website about a movie festival using the UI framework Bootstrap
with two different (but not so different) pages/layouts.
To navigate to the second page click the "more" button under The Shining poster (no other "more" buttons work/go anywhere) and back again using any button on the navbar. On the main page if you happen to click the movies link it will scroll down a little, since it is a small page.

Bootstrap made things easier at times, I had to stop myself often from just going to the CSS file (my comfort zone) but I managed to position and style most of the content, I sneaked a tiny bit of css for the little things I just couldn't figure out. For example I could not find out how to stick the footer completely to the bottom with Bootstrap (so I used CSS in a bit of a huff, might have been hangry).
